- fixed recent issues
- fixed a crash with quiver when other mods would hijack the consume arrow code, leaving the quiver looping forever truing to decrement arrows it didnt have
- fixed ropes not being able to pull up block entities
- fixed lanterns not being placeable below ropes due to broken tag
- rewrote rope logic, improving what they can push and not push. for example they will be able to push and pull stuff that pistons cant like lanterns and wont be able to touch stuff that would be broken like torches
- fixed rope screen shake in spectator
